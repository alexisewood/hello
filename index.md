## My name is Alexis Wood.

I am a first-year Geography PhD student at the University California, Berkeley researching the growing intersections between climate change, digital geographies, and rural socio-political movements. I am particularly interested in secessionist state movements, and how participants incorporate heightening levels of climate anxiety with exisiting feelings of rural marginalization in the physical and digital landscapes. I am both a theorist and geospatial analyst, and look to merge the two through experimental geospatial methods and cartography at Berkeley's geospatial lab, Studio.Geo-?.

Before starting my PhD program, I worked as a Data Cooridnator for the Redistricting Data Hub, collecting and processing this redistricting cycle's Community of Interest (COI) maps. 

I am a system-impacted, first-generation high school graduate and a product of the California Community College system, transfering into Berkeley as an undergraduate. In this, I am very passionate about helping non-traditional students make their way to university and beyond - please reach out to me with questions about California Community Colleges, the University of California system, and/or application processes.
